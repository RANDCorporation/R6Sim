\title{Runs R6Experiment in parallel}
\usage{
R6Experiment_run(
  self,
  n_cores,
  parallel,
  cluster_eval_script,
  model_from_cluster_eval,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{self}{experiment object}

\item{n_cores}{number of cores to use}

\item{parallel}{whether to evaluate run in parallel}

\item{cluster_eval_script}{path to script that instantiates necessary functions. this will often mean sourcing functions external to the package and loading dependencies for the model. needed if parallel = T}

\item{model_from_cluster_eval}{T if model is instantiated in the cluter eval scripts, F otherwise. Use T if using models that need compilation (like odin) and F otherwise.}

\item{...}{additional parameters to be passed to the model simulation function.}
}
\value{
results data.frame from all simulations in parallel
}
\description{
This function is most useful to simulate the posterior distribution for a single model in parallel in one machine. This function is not used when calibrating the model and not useful for parallelization across multiple nodes.
