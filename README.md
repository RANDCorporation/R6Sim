`R6Sim` provides an `R6`-based framework for simulation modeling in R
for modelers who like their models object-oriented. This requires you
specify your simulation models as `R6` classes, and in return, provides
a set of tools to help you organize your simulation modeling study by
specifying your model and your simulation experiment as a class.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `R6Sim` like so:

``` r
# install the remotes package if you do not have it
# install.packages("remotes")
# install from github:
remotes::install_github("randcorporation/r6sim")
# or install from CRAN (in the near future)
install.packages("R6Sim")
```
