`R6Sim` provides an `R6`-based framework for simulation modeling in R
for those who would like the encapsulated object-oriented programming
approach provided by `R6`. This package allows one to create a model
that inherits`R6Sim`, and specify experimental designs using multiple
models.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `R6Sim` like so:

``` r
# install the remotes package if you do not have it
# install.packages("remotes")
# install from github:
remotes::install_github("randcorporation/r6sim")
# or install from CRAN (in the near future)
install.packages("R6Sim")
```
