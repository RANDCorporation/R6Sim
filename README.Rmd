`R6Sim` provides an `R6` base class for simulation modeling for those who appreciate the structure of encapsulated object-oriented programming provided by `R6`. This package allows one to create a model that inherits `R6Sim`, and specify experimental designs that potentially use multiple models using the `R6Experiment` class.

We use `R6Sim` across multiple projects, and the purpose of releasing it publicly is to facilitate reproducibility and enhance the quality, agility and reliability of code used in simulation-based policy research projects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `R6Sim` like so:

``` r
# install the remotes package if you do not have it
# install.packages("remotes")
# install from github:
remotes::install_github("randcorporation/r6sim")
```
