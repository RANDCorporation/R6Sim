`R6Sim` provides an `R6` base class for simulation modeling analyses using the structure of encapsulated object-oriented programming provided by `R6`. This package allows one to create models that inherit `R6Sim`, and specify models and experimental designs that can use multiple models using the `R6Experiment` class.

# Why `R6Sim`

Simulation modeling projects performed in R often rely on poorly-designed code bases, where the modeler and others don't have visibility into what the model does and all the inputs the model needs to run. Often, there is a tight dependence on inputs that may live in the global environment, *or* the modeler adds an large set of function parameters that percolate through the code and are passed through several layers of functions.

My opinion is that one of the reasons for those problems is the overuse of the functional programming paradigm, whereas an encapsulated object-oriented paradigm could be helpful. In particular, I want my simulation models to be self-contained, and I want to be able to create simulation studies where I can extend the model to other use-cases and create experiments with multiple versions of the same model. After doing modeling projects in R for several years, I arrived at this simple pattern where the model is an R6 class, and there's another class (which I call an experiment), that can include one *or more* models, and can run those models. 

Each model can have its own inputs, and one ore more joint probability distributions of model parameters (sometimes obtained via bayesian calibration). Then, all I want is to create an experiment and run it in parallel. And I don't want to re-create that code architecture in every project. `R6Sim` is my current solution for this type of problem. `R6Sim` is a generalization of `crcrdm`, which I had created for cancer screening models.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `R6Sim` like so:

``` r
# install the remotes package if you do not have it
# install.packages("remotes")
# install from github:
remotes::install_github("randcorporation/r6sim")
```

## Usage

The [introductory vignette](https://randcorporation.github.io/r6sim/articles/introduction.html) provides an overview of the `R6Sim` and the `R6Experiment` classes, and how to use them to create simulation studies.
